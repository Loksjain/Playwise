| Move Song | O(n) | Linked list traversal |
| Song Lookup | O(1) | Hash map access |
| Rating Search | O(log n) | BST traversal |
| Sort Playlist | O(n log n) | Merge/Quick sort |
| Undo Operations | O(n*m) | Stack operations |

### Space Complexity
| Component | Complexity | Rationale |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| Playlist | O(n) | Linked list nodes |
| History | O(n) | Stack storage |
| Rating Tree | O(n) | BST nodes |
| Lookup | O(n) | Hash maps |
| Sorting | O(n) | Temporary arrays |
